# Coach Carter — Website Development Roadmap

## Overview

This document tracks the development of the **Coach Carter driving school platform** — a comprehensive web application for booking lessons, processing payments, tracking learner competency, and providing AI-powered learning tools. The platform includes a learner portal, instructor portal, admin portal, Stripe-integrated payments (with Klarna), a DL25-aligned 17-skill competency framework, AI chat features powered by Claude, and full Progressive Web App (PWA) support for installable, offline-capable access.

---

## Phase 1: Booking & Payment System ✅ Complete

### 1.1 — Lesson Credits & Payments ✅

**How it works:**
Learners purchase lesson credits through the website. Each credit equals one 1.5-hour lesson. Payments are processed through Stripe, with Klarna available as a payment method for spreading the cost. Bulk discount tiers apply automatically based on quantity.

**Key decisions:**
- Lesson length: **1.5 hours** (fixed, single slot type for now)
- Base price: **£82.50 per credit**
- Bulk discounts applied at checkout:
  - 4 credits (6hrs) → 5% off
  - 8 credits (12hrs) → 10% off
  - 12 credits (18hrs) → 15% off
  - 16 credits (24hrs) → 20% off
  - 20 credits (30hrs) → 25% off
- Credits are **refundable**
- Credits are stored as a balance on the learner's account

**What was built:**
- ✅ `api/credits.js` — balance lookup and Stripe checkout with bulk discount logic
- ✅ `api/webhook.js` — updated to handle `credit_purchase` payments, writes to Neon DB atomically
- ✅ `public/learner/buy-credits.html` — quantity selector, discount tier cards, live price breakdown, Klarna note
- ✅ Confirmation email to learner on successful purchase
- ✅ Klarna enabled (payment methods inherited from Stripe dashboard)

---

### 1.2 — Instructor Availability & Calendar ✅

**How it works:**
Each instructor has recurring weekly availability windows. The system automatically divides these into bookable 1.5-hour slots. Booked slots are removed from the calendar in real time.

**Key decisions:**
- Calendar is **custom-built** (no third-party dependency)
- Learners can book **any available instructor**, not just a specific one
- Booking is **instant confirmation** — no instructor approval needed
- Learners can book up to **3 months in advance**
- **48-hour cancellation policy** — cancellations with 48+ hours notice automatically return the credit

**What was built:**
- ✅ `api/instructors.js` — instructor CRUD + weekly availability window management (admin-protected)
- ✅ `api/slots.js` — slot generation engine, booking, cancellation, and my-bookings endpoints
- ✅ `public/learner/book.html` — week-by-week calendar UI, instructor filter, booking confirmation modal, cancellation modal with 48-hour policy display
- ✅ Confirmation emails to both learner and instructor on booking and cancellation
- ✅ 48-hour cancellation policy enforced server-side with automatic credit return
- ✅ Race condition protection via DB unique index on instructor/date/time

---

### 1.3 — Data Model ✅

All tables live in **Neon (PostgreSQL)**. Migration file: `db/migrations/001_booking_system.sql`.

**`learner_users`** *(extended)*
- Added: `credit_balance` (integer, DB constraint prevents negative), `phone`

**`instructors`**
- Name, email, phone, bio, photo URL, active flag

**`instructor_availability`**
- Recurring weekly windows per instructor (day_of_week 0–6, start_time, end_time)

**`lesson_bookings`**
- Learner → Instructor link, date/time (90 min enforced at DB level)
- Status: confirmed / completed / cancelled
- Tracks whether credit was returned on cancellation
- Unique index prevents double-booking a slot

**`credit_transactions`**
- Full audit trail: type (purchase/refund/slot_purchase), credits, amount in pence, payment method, Stripe IDs

**`slot_reservations`**
- Holds slots during Stripe Checkout (10-minute TTL)
- instructor_id, scheduled_date, start_time, end_time, learner_id, stripe_session_id, expires_at
- Excluded from availability results; cleaned up after payment or expiry

**`magic_link_tokens`**
- Token, email, phone, method (email/sms), expires_at (15 min), used flag
- Two-step verification: validate (GET, read-only) then verify (POST, consumes token)

---

### 1.4 — User Flows ✅

**Learner purchases credits:**
1. Learner logs in → navigates to "Buy Credits"
2. Selects quantity (discount tier cards highlight applicable discount)
3. Pays via Stripe (card or Klarna)
4. Stripe webhook confirms payment → credits added to balance, confirmation email sent

**Learner books a lesson (has credits):**
1. Learner logs in → opens booking calendar (`/learner/book.html`)
2. Browses available slots week by week (filter by instructor optional)
3. Clicks a slot → confirmation modal shows date, time, instructor, credit cost
4. Confirms → 1 credit deducted, booking confirmed, both parties emailed

**Learner books a lesson (no credits — pay per slot):**
1. Learner opens booking calendar with 0 credits
2. Banner shows: "No lessons on your account. No worries — you can pay when you book, or buy a bundle to save."
3. Clicks a slot → modal shows "Pay £82.50 & book" path instead of credit deduction
4. Clicks pay → slot reserved for 10 minutes, redirected to Stripe Checkout (£82.50)
5. Stripe webhook confirms payment → 1 credit added + immediately deducted, booking confirmed, both parties emailed with .ics calendar attachment
6. If payment cancelled or abandoned → reservation expires after 10 minutes, slot released back to calendar

**Learner cancels a lesson:**
1. Learner views upcoming bookings at top of calendar page
2. Clicks Cancel → modal shows whether credit will be returned (48hr check)
3. If 48+ hours before lesson → credit returned automatically
4. If under 48 hours → credit forfeited, learner informed of policy

- ✅ Renamed `api/update-statis.js` → `api/update-status.js` to match frontend API calls

### 2.2 — Instructor Self-Service Portal ✅ Complete

Instructors can log in, view their own schedule, mark lessons complete, and manage their availability and profile — without needing admin access.

**What was built:**

- ✅ `db/migrations/003_calendar_token.sql` — `calendar_token` column on `learner_users`, indexed for fast polling
- ✅ Feed URL exposed to learners via `GET /api/calendar?action=feed-url`

### 2.3b — Inbound iCal Feed Sync ✅ Complete

Instructors can paste their personal calendar's iCal feed URL (Google, Outlook, Apple) into their profile page. A cron job polls feeds every 15 minutes and stores busy-time blocks. Slot generation checks these events alongside bookings and blackout dates — overlapping slots are automatically blocked for learners. No OAuth; works with any calendar provider.

**What was built:**
- ✅ `db/migrations/022_ical_sync.sql` — `instructor_external_events` table + `ical_feed_url`, `ical_last_synced_at`, `ical_sync_error` columns on `instructors`
- ✅ `api/ical-sync.js` — Vercel cron job (every 15 min), processes 1 instructor per invocation, expands RRULE recurring events, upserts via uid_hash dedup

### 2.5 — Pay-Per-Slot Booking ✅ Complete

Allow learners with 0 credits to pay for a single lesson at the point of booking instead of requiring them to buy credits first.

**What was built:**
- ✅ Dual-path booking modal — detects credit balance and shows either "Confirm booking" (use credit) or "Pay £82.50 & book" (Stripe Checkout)
- ✅ `api/slots.js` `checkout-slot` action — creates Stripe Checkout session with `payment_type: 'slot_booking'` metadata
- ✅ Slot reservation system — `slot_reservations` table holds slot for 10 minutes during payment, excluded from availability
- ✅ `api/webhook.js` `handleSlotBooking` — processes payment, atomically adds/deducts credit, creates booking, sends .ics calendar attachment to both parties

Fixed magic link login — email clients were pre-fetching the verify link and consuming the token before the learner clicked it. Applied to both learner and instructor logins.

**What was built:**
- ✅ New `validate` endpoint (GET) — lightweight token check that does NOT mark it as used
- ✅ `verify` endpoint changed to POST-only — only browser JavaScript can consume the token
- ✅ `public/learner/verify.html` — two-step flow: validate (GET) then verify (POST)
- ✅ `api/instructor.js` — new `validate-token` (GET) + `verify-token` changed to POST-only

- ✅ `public/shared/learner-auth.js` — `ccAuth.getAuth()`, `ccAuth.logout()`, `ccAuth.requireAuth()`, `ccAuth.getToken()`
- ✅ `public/shared/instructor-auth.js` — same API for instructor portal
- ✅ Updated 13 learner pages and 5 instructor pages to use shared CSS (~984 lines of duplicated CSS removed)
- ✅ Updated 13 learner pages and 5 instructor pages to use shared auth JS (inline localStorage reads/logout functions replaced with `ccAuth` calls)

**Part 3: Email Error Alerts**
- ✅ `api/_error-alert.js` — fire-and-forget `reportError()` utility using existing SMTP config
- ✅ Added `reportError()` before every `res.status(500)` call across 21 API files
- ✅ Sends formatted email with endpoint, error message, and stack trace
- ✅ Requires `ERROR_ALERT_EMAIL` env var (silently no-ops if not set)
- ✅ Non-blocking — does not await, does not slow error responses

### 2.36 — Multiple Lesson Types & Hours-Based Balance ✅ Complete (31 March 2026)

Replaced fixed 90-min/1-credit lessons with variable-duration lesson types and an hours-based balance system.

**What was built:**

- ✅ Seeded: Standard Lesson (90min/£82.50), 2-Hour Lesson (120min/£110)
- ✅ `balance_minutes` column on learner_users — hours-based balance (stored as minutes internally)
- ✅ Existing credit balances migrated: `balance_minutes = credit_balance × 90`
- ✅ `lesson_type_id` + `minutes_deducted` on lesson_bookings for audit trail
- ✅ Slot generation engine (`api/slots.js`) accepts `lesson_type_id` for variable-duration slots
- ✅ All booking flows (book, checkout-slot, cancel, reschedule) use minutes-based balance
- ✅ `api/credits.js` sells hours at £55/hr with discount tiers (6/12/18/24/30 hrs)
- ✅ Webhook dual-writes `credit_balance` + `balance_minutes` for rollback safety
- ✅ Admin portal: Lesson Types CRUD management section
- ✅ Learner booking page: lesson type selector (shown when multiple types exist)
- ✅ Buy Credits → Buy Hours page with hour-based packages
- ✅ Dashboard, sidebar, emails, WhatsApp, ICS all show hours instead of credits

Fourth calendar view mode for instructors showing a scrollable list of upcoming lessons.

**What was built:**
- ✅ "Agenda" button in instructor calendar toolbar alongside Daily/Weekly/Monthly
- ✅ 14-day rolling window of bookings grouped by date headers
- ✅ Each card: time, colour-coded lesson type badge, learner name, pickup address, status
- ✅ Date headers clickable to drill into daily view
- ✅ Respects showCancelled toggle
- ✅ Cards open existing booking detail modal
- ✅ ±14 day navigation, Today button works

### 2.39 — Learner Dashboard Navigation Hub ✅ Complete (31 March 2026)

Redesigned learner dashboard as a navigation hub focused on learning, not upselling.

**What was built:**
- ✅ 5 quick-action buttons: Mock Test, Ask Examiner, Book Lessons, Progress, Quiz
- ✅ Removed "Hours Remaining" credit balance card (felt like upselling, not learner-focused)
- ✅ Upcoming lessons section retained
- ✅ Profile completion card simplified to 2 steps only: Prior Experience + Initial Assessment
- ✅ Profile card CTA copy adapts: "Add Your Experience" or "Complete Skill Assessment" based on next step

### 2.40 — Navigation Alignment: Desktop Groups + Fixed Mobile Tabs ✅ Complete (31 March 2026)

Aligned desktop and mobile navigation so both surfaces share the same mental model of sections and subsections.

**What was built:**
- ✅ Desktop sidebar: Lessons, Practice, Learn now expand as collapsible groups (accordion — one open at a time) revealing subsection links. Auto-expands to current section on page load.
- ✅ Mobile bottom bar: replaced contextual tabs that changed per-section with 5 fixed tabs (Home, Lessons, Practice, Learn, Profile) — consistent muscle memory across all pages
- ✅ Mobile header hamburger restored so users can access the sidebar on mobile (previously hidden when bottom bar was present)
- ✅ Active tab on mobile highlights based on `activeOn` mapping — e.g. visiting `/learner/mock-test.html` lights up the Practice tab
- ✅ Single file change: `public/sidebar.js` only

### 2.41 — UI/Design Refresh: Borderless Cards + App-Style Polish ✅ Complete (31 March 2026)

Mobbin-inspired visual refresh across the learner and instructor portals, bringing the aesthetic closer to top iOS apps (Revolut, Calm, Freenow, komoot).

**What was built:**
- ✅ Cards site-wide: removed all `border: 1px solid` from `.card`, `.choice-card`, `.quick-action-card`, `.stat-pill`, `.progress-card`, `.upcoming-card`, `.profile-card`, `.cal-sync-banner` — replaced with neutral ambient shadows
- ✅ Upcoming lesson cards retain the orange left-border accent, all others are fully borderless
- ✅ `.choice-card` hover: removed border-colour change, now uses shadow depth only
- ✅ Bottom tab active state: warm pill highlight (`#fff4ec` background) instead of orange text alone
- ✅ Changes via CSS injection in `sidebar.js` — no edits to individual page files
- ✅ `public/shared-auth.css` updated for login/choice card styles

### 2.42 — Instructor Calendar: Timepage-Style Weekly View ✅ Complete (31 March 2026)

Replaced the time-grid weekly view (which crushed columns on mobile) with an agenda-style layout inspired by Timepage.

**What was built:**
- ✅ Each day is a horizontal row: compact day label (DOW + date number) on the left, lesson cards on the right
- ✅ Lesson cards have a coloured left-bar matching the lesson type colour
- ✅ Today's day label is highlighted in orange
- ✅ Empty days show "No lessons" placeholder
- ✅ Tap day label → drills into daily view; tap lesson card → opens booking detail modal
- ✅ Preserves: cancelled/completed styling, `hideWeekends` filter, `showCancelled` toggle, lesson type colours
- ✅ Scales naturally to any screen width — no more crushed columns on mobile
- ✅ Changes in `public/instructor/index.html` only (CSS + `renderWeekly()` function)

### 2.43 — Floating Pill Bottom Nav Bar ✅ Complete (31 March 2026)

Replaced the edge-to-edge fixed bottom bar with a floating pill — matching the premium app style of Revolut, Linear, and top iOS apps.

**What was built:**
- ✅ Bar floats 12px above the bottom edge with 10px side margins (not full-width)
- ✅ `border-radius: 26px` — fully rounded pill shape
- ✅ `backdrop-filter: blur(20px)` frosted glass effect on the bar background
- ✅ Layered shadow (`0 8px 32px` + `0 2px 8px`) for depth
- ✅ Subtle `1px border` at `rgba(0,0,0,0.06)` for edge definition
- ✅ Inactive tabs: lighter grey `#a0a0a0`; active: orange icon + warm `#fff3e8` pill
- ✅ Active icon scales 1.1× with bolder stroke (2.5)
- ✅ Home tab: switched from dashboard/grid icon to house icon
- ✅ Safe area inset handled via `max(12px, env(safe-area-inset-bottom))`
- ✅ Content height updated from 72px to 80px to account for floating offset

### 2.44 — Dashboard Redesign: Hero Cards, Pills & Action Cards ✅ Complete (1 April 2026)

Replaced the top section of both learner and instructor dashboards with an app-style layout inspired by Klarna, Zing, and Monday.com. Prioritises answering "when's my next lesson?" and reducing clutter.

**What was built (Learner — `public/learner/index.html`):**
- ✅ Compact greeting (`Hi, {name}`) replacing the old welcome banner + subtitle
- ✅ **Next Lesson hero card** — orange gradient card showing next upcoming lesson: date, time, instructor, countdown ("In 3 hours", "Tomorrow"), plus 52px readiness ring (white-on-orange)
- ✅ Dashed empty state with "Book a Lesson" CTA when no lessons exist
- ✅ **Quick Access Pills** — horizontal scrollable row of 5 circular icon shortcuts (Progress, Videos, Quiz, Examiner AI, Log Session) with coloured backgrounds
- ✅ **Colour Action Cards** — 3-column grid: Book Lesson (orange gradient), Buy Credits (green gradient), Mock Test (blue gradient)
- ✅ Upcoming section now shows 2nd+ lessons (1st is in hero card); hidden when 0–1 lessons
- ✅ Calendar sync banner moved outside upcoming section so it always shows
- ✅ Inline SVG icons throughout (no emojis)

**What was built (Instructor — `public/instructor/index.html`):**
- ✅ Compact greeting (`Hi, {first name}`)
- ✅ **Next Lesson hero card** — same orange gradient style, shows countdown ("In 45m"), learner name, pickup address, phone. Right side shows today's lesson count stat bubble
- ✅ Empty state with "Add a Lesson" CTA
- ✅ **Quick Access Pills** — Learners (blue), Earnings (green), Availability (purple), Q&A (orange), Profile (grey)
- ✅ **Colour Action Cards** — Add Lesson (orange), Set Availability (purple), View Earnings (green)
- ✅ Glance stats row moved below new section
- ✅ Print CSS updated to exclude new elements

**Key decisions:**
- Reused existing API data (`BOOKINGS_DATA.upcoming[0]` for learner, `bookingCache` for instructor) — no new endpoints
- Pills are "browse" shortcuts; action cards are primary CTAs — separates discovery from doing
- Hidden scrollbar on pill row for clean mobile swipe
- Action cards collapse to horizontal scroll only below 340px (not 380px, so standard iPhone widths get the grid)

### 2.45 — Learner Weekly Availability + Waiting List ✅ Complete (1 April 2026)

Two companion features: learners declare their typical free times, and a waitlist notifies them when matching slots open via cancellation.

**What was built:**
- ✅ `learner_availability` table — mirrors `instructor_availability` (day_of_week + time range), max 14 windows per learner
- ✅ `waitlist` table — optional day/time prefs, instructor, lesson type; status lifecycle (active → notified → booked/expired), 14-day auto-expiry
- ✅ `api/learner.js` — `my-availability` + `set-availability` actions (delete-and-insert, 30-min boundaries)
- ✅ `api/waitlist.js` — `join`, `my-waitlist`, `leave` actions + `checkWaitlistOnCancel()` internal function
- ✅ `api/slots.js` — cancellation hook: both single and series cancellations trigger waitlist matching (fire-and-forget)
- ✅ Profile page: "My Availability" card (day rows with time chips, add/remove, overlap detection) + "My Waitlist" card (entries with status badges, leave button)
- ✅ Booking page: "Notify me when a slot opens" button on empty state, inline form with day/time/instructor prefs or "match my availability" checkbox
- ✅ Notifications: WhatsApp + email to all matching learners when a slot frees up

**Key decisions:**
- Notify-all approach (not sequential) — existing `uq_instructor_slot` unique index + 10-min Stripe reservation prevents double-booking
- Waitlist matching uses two branches: explicit entry prefs OR learner_availability fallback (via EXISTS subquery)
- Auto-expiry on read (no cron) — stale entries expired in `checkWaitlistOnCancel` and `my-waitlist`
- Max 10 active waitlist entries per learner

---

## Phase 3: Next Up (Prioritised)

### 2.46 — Instructor Profile Enhancement ✅ Complete (1 April 2026)

Extended the instructor profile with qualifications, vehicle, service area, and languages — preparing for multi-school/multi-instructor support.

- **Qualifications & Experience** — ADI grade, pass rate %, years of experience, specialisms chip selector (8 options)
- **Vehicle** — make, model, transmission type (manual/automatic/both), dual controls toggle
- **Service Area** — comma-separated postcodes/areas, stored as JSONB for future geo-search
- **Languages** — comma-separated, JSONB array, defaults to English
- **DB**: 10 new columns on `instructors` table (JSONB arrays for specialisms, service_areas, languages)
- **API**: Extended `profile` GET and `update-profile` POST with validation
- **Files**: `db/migration.sql`, `api/instructor.js`, `public/instructor/profile.html`

---

### 2.47 — Instructor Portal Cleanup ✅ Complete (1 April 2026)

Bug fixes and UI cleanup across the instructor portal.

- **Fix**: Profile page JS parse error — backslash-backtick (`\``) in `loadBookingLinks` was a literal backslash+backtick, not a valid template literal. Replaced with string concatenation. Also extracted specialisms chip builder from nested template literal.
- **Fix**: Earnings page 500 error — `earnings-week` query referenced `instructor_notes` column that was missing from production DB (table created before column was added to schema; `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` skipped it). Removed unused column from query and added idempotent `ALTER TABLE`.
- **Fix**: Earnings page "Invalid Date" — Neon returns Postgres date columns as objects, not ISO strings. Added `toDateStr()` normalizer.
- **UI**: Removed redundant fixed header bar (CoachCarter branding + Sign out) from all 6 instructor pages. The sidebar already provides both. This was overlapping page content and blocking summary cards on earnings. Reduced page `margin-top` from 124px to 64px.
- **Files**: All 6 `public/instructor/*.html`, `api/instructor.js`, `db/migration.sql`

---

### 2.48 — Stripe Connect & Weekly Instructor Payouts ✅ Complete (1 April 2026)

Automated instructor payouts via Stripe Connect Express accounts. Learner payments land in the platform account as before, then instructor earnings are transferred every Friday via a Vercel cron job.

- **Stripe Connect Express** — instructors onboard via Stripe's hosted flow (self-service from earnings page or admin-triggered invite email)
- **Weekly cron job** (`api/cron-payouts.js`) — runs every Friday 9am UTC. Finds eligible bookings (completed OR confirmed 3+ days old), calculates instructor share (price × commission_rate), creates Stripe transfers, sends email notifications
- **Safety**: `UNIQUE(booking_id)` constraint on `payout_line_items` prevents double-payment even if cron and manual trigger fire simultaneously
- **Admin controls**: Payouts section in admin portal with connect status table, upcoming estimates, pause/resume toggle per instructor, manual "Process Payouts Now" trigger
- **Platform owner handling**: "Not needed" dismiss button for instructors who own the platform and don't need payouts (clears half-created accounts, hides banner permanently)
- **Webhook**: `account.updated` event auto-marks `stripe_onboarding_complete = TRUE` when instructor finishes Stripe onboarding
- **New files**: `api/connect.js` (6 actions), `api/cron-payouts.js`, `api/_payout-helpers.js`
- **New tables**: `instructor_payouts`, `payout_line_items`
- **New columns**: `instructors.stripe_account_id`, `instructors.stripe_onboarding_complete`, `instructors.payouts_paused`
- **Modified**: `api/instructor.js` (+2 actions), `api/admin.js` (+4 actions), `api/webhook.js`, `vercel.json`, `public/instructor/earnings.html`, `public/admin/portal.html`

### 2.49 — Fixed Weekly Franchise Fee Model ✅ Complete (2 April 2026)

Alternative billing model: instead of taking a percentage commission per lesson, the platform takes a fixed weekly franchise fee (e.g. £50/week or £200/week). The instructor keeps all lesson revenue minus the fee.

- **Two fee models** per instructor, configurable via admin portal dropdown: "Commission (%)" or "Franchise Fee (fixed weekly)"
- **New columns**: `instructors.weekly_franchise_fee_pence` (NULL = commission model), `instructor_payouts.franchise_fee_pence` (audit trail)
- **Payout logic**: franchise fee capped at weekly gross — instructor never goes negative
- **Earnings display**: franchise model shows gross/fee/net breakdown on weekly view; bottom note shows "Franchise fee: £X/week" instead of commission rate
- **Backward compatible**: NULL franchise fee = legacy commission_rate model (no existing behaviour changed)
- **Modified**: `api/_payout-helpers.js`, `api/instructor.js` (4 earnings endpoints), `api/admin.js`, `api/instructors.js`, `public/admin/portal.html`, `public/instructor/earnings.html`, `db/migration.sql`

---

### 3.1 — Push Notifications

PWA push notifications for lesson reminders, quiz nudges, and new message alerts.

### 3.2 — Automated Lesson Reminders

24-hour email/WhatsApp reminder to learner and instructor before each lesson. Needs Vercel cron job.

### 3.3 — Refund Flow

Learner requests cash refund from dashboard, admin approves in portal, Stripe processes reversal.

### 3.4 — Referral System

Unique referral link per learner. Both referrer and new learner receive hours bonus on first purchase.

### 3.5 — Recurring/Repeat Bookings

"Repeat weekly" option when booking — creates multiple bookings in one transaction. Depends on lesson types (Feature 3).

### 3.6 — Per-Service Booking Links

URL parameter support: `/learner/book?type=2hr` pre-selects lesson type. Shareable links for marketing.

### 3.7 — GDPR Full Compliance (3 April 2026)

Full GDPR compliance pass across the entire platform. Addresses cookie consent, data portability, right to erasure, data retention, and audit logging.

**What was built:**
- Cookie consent banner on all 35 HTML pages — PostHog analytics only loads after explicit user consent
- Data export API (`POST /api/learner?action=export-data`) — learners download all personal data as JSON
- User-initiated account deletion (`request-deletion` + `confirm-deletion`) — email-verified cascading delete
- Credit transactions anonymized (not deleted) for 7-year tax retention
- Data retention cron (`api/cron-retention.js`) — weekly, archives inactive learners >3 years, purges after 90 days
- Audit logging (`api/_audit.js`) — tracks admin data mutations (delete, adjust credits, instructor changes)
- Consent recording to DB with hashed IP for audit proof
- `last_activity_at` updates on login and booking for retention policy
- Privacy & Data section in learner profile (export, cookie preferences, delete account)
- Cookie Settings link in sidebar footer and landing page

**Files created:** `public/cookie-consent.js`, `public/posthog-loader.js`, `public/learner/confirm-deletion.html`, `api/cron-retention.js`, `api/_audit.js`
**Files modified:** 35 HTML files, `api/learner.js`, `api/admin.js`, `api/config.js`, `api/magic-link.js`, `api/slots.js`, `db/migration.sql`, `public/sidebar.js`, `public/learner/profile.html`, `vercel.json`
**DB:** 3 new tables (`cookie_consents`, `audit_log`, `deletion_requests`), 5 new columns, FK change on `credit_transactions`

### 3.8 — Database Security & Performance Hardening (3 April 2026)

Security hardening and query performance optimization across the entire platform.

**Security fixes:**
- Fixed SQL injection pattern — replaced dynamic table/column name interpolation with explicit parameterized queries in 3 files
- Added security headers to all responses via middleware.js (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy)
- Centralised CORS in middleware.js — restricted from `*` to coachcarter.uk/co.uk domains only, removed per-file CORS from 31 API files
- Rate limiting on magic link sends (5 per email/phone per hour) via `rate_limits` DB table
- Verified Neon SSL (`sslmode=require` + `channel_binding=require`) and connection pooling

**Performance — 28 new indexes:**
- FK indexes on lesson_bookings (learner_id, instructor_id, lesson_type_id), credit_transactions, driving_sessions, skill_ratings, quiz_results, mock_tests, qa_questions/answers, slot_reservations, instructor_learner_notes
- Composite indexes: (school_id, status, scheduled_date), (instructor_id, scheduled_date, start_time), (learner_id, status)
- Partial indexes on magic_link_tokens (email/phone WHERE NOT NULL)
- Medium priority: lesson_confirmations, sent_reminders, lesson_offers, instructor_availability, admin_users

**Also in this session:**
- Replaced JSON data export download with readable "My Data" page (`/learner/my-data.html`) matching privacy/terms page style
- Profile page: Export button replaced with subtle text links (View my data · Cookie preferences · Privacy policy)
- Test data seed endpoint (`/api/seed-test-data`) creating 3 test accounts with realistic data for GDPR flow testing
- Updated privacy policy to platform model (CoachCarter as sole Data Controller for all schools)
- Cookie consent banner added to all 47 HTML pages (11 were missing initially)
- Fixed multiple column name mismatches in export queries (qa_questions, skill_ratings, quiz_results, mock_tests, learner_onboarding)

**Files created:** `api/seed-test-data.js`, `public/learner/my-data.html`
**Files modified:** `middleware.js`, `api/admin.js`, `api/learner.js`, `api/cron-retention.js`, `api/magic-link.js`, `db/migration.sql`, 31 API files (CORS removal), `public/privacy.html`, `public/learner/profile.html`, `CLAUDE.md`
**DB:** 1 new table (`rate_limits`), 28 new indexes, `last_activity_at` DEFAULT NOW()

- **Intensive course packages** — multi-day bundled bookings with special pricing

---

## 2.50 — Setmore Booking Sync (April 2026)

**What:** Ongoing sync from Setmore (third-party booking system) into CoachCarter's built-in booking system. Both systems run in parallel during the transition.

**Built:**
- `api/setmore-sync.js` — cron every 15 min, imports Setmore appointments as real `lesson_bookings`
- OAuth2 auth via `SETMORE_REFRESH_TOKEN` env var
- Auto-creates/matches learner accounts by phone number or email
- Idempotent via `setmore_key` unique index on `lesson_bookings`
- Service mapping strips Setmore's built-in 30-min buffer from lesson durations
- Resolves correct instructor from each appointment's `staff_key`
- 3 new lesson types: 3-Hour Lesson (active), 1-Hour Lesson (inactive), Free Trial (inactive)
- ✅ Cancellation detection — marks bookings as cancelled when Setmore appointments are cancelled or removed
- ✅ `api/setmore-welcome.js` — daily cron sends one-time welcome email with 7-day magic link to Setmore-created learners
- ✅ `api/_travel-time.js` — travel time check between pickup postcodes using OpenRouteService, integrated into booking flow as a warning
- ✅ Pickup address import — pulls address from Setmore customer profile (`address`, `city`, `postal_code`) into `lesson_bookings.pickup_address`, with backfill for existing bookings
- ✅ "Slots hidden" banner on `book.html` — shows learners how many slots were filtered by travel distance
- ✅ Admin `max_travel_minutes` setting — per-instructor travel threshold editable from admin portal instructor form

**Transition plan:** New bookings through CoachCarter, existing Setmore clients migrate gradually, then remove sync.

## 2.51 — Pickup Address & Buy Lesson Types (2 April 2026)

**What:** Improve the travel-time slot filtering UX and give learners a choice of lesson types when purchasing.

**Built:**
- ✅ Pickup postcode prompt on `book.html` — inline input above calendar for learners without a `pickup_address`, saves to profile via existing `update_profile` API, then re-fetches slots with travel filter active. Non-blocking.
- ✅ Learner address backfill in `setmore-sync.js` — step 5d copies the most recent booking's `pickup_address` to `learner_users.pickup_address` when the learner's profile field is empty. Scoped per-instructor, idempotent.
- ✅ Single lesson type cards on `buy-credits.html` — dynamically fetched from `/api/lesson-types`, each card shows name, duration, price, and colour-coded Buy button. "Or save with hour packages" divider separates from bulk discounts.
- ✅ Test Ready Guarantee section temporarily hidden (`display:none`) pending review.

**Files changed:** `public/learner/book.html`, `public/learner/buy-credits.html`, `api/setmore-sync.js`

## 2.52 — "Next Available" Slot Feed (3 April 2026)

**What:** Replace the weekly/monthly/daily time-grid calendar on the booking page with a clean "next available" feed. Learners see only available slots, sorted by date+time — no empty hours or empty days.

**Built:**
- ✅ Slot feed — flat scrollable list of slot cards showing date, time, instructor, lesson type colour. No grid, no timeline.
- ✅ Sticky lesson type pill bar — compact pills below the header (`position: sticky`), always visible while scrolling. Shows type name, duration, price.
- ✅ Progressive loading — 14 days at a time with "Show more slots" button (up to 90 days).
- ✅ Removed ~500 lines of old calendar CSS/JS: 3 renderers (monthly/weekly/daily), view toggle, date navigation arrows, cursor state, drillToDay.
- ✅ Admin adjust-credits fix — transaction log INSERT made best-effort so balance updates succeed even if the log fails.
- ✅ Postcode save fix — corrected action name (`update_profile` → `update-profile`).

**Files changed:** `public/learner/book.html`, `api/admin.js`

## 2.53 — Instructor Blackout Date Ranges (3 April 2026)

**What:** Instructors can now block out a date range (start + end date) instead of adding one day at a time. Ideal for holidays or extended time off.

**Built:**
- ✅ DB migration — added `end_date` column to `instructor_blackout_dates`, backfills existing single-day rows, new composite index
- ✅ API — GET `blackout-dates` returns `start_date` + `end_date`; POST `set-blackout-dates` accepts `{ ranges: [{ start_date, end_date, reason }] }` with overlap + max 365-day validation
- ✅ Slot filtering — range overlap query in `slots.js`, expands ranges into per-day Set entries (slot generation loop unchanged)
- ✅ UI — two date pickers (start/end), end auto-follows start, overlap check on add, ranges display as "Mon 3 Apr – Fri 7 Apr 2026" with day count badge

**Files changed:** `db/migration.sql`, `api/instructor.js`, `api/slots.js`, `public/instructor/availability.html`

- **Shared frontend:** CSS in `public/shared/learner.css` + `instructor.css`, auth JS in `public/shared/learner-auth.js` + `instructor-auth.js`
- **Error alerting:** Email alerts on 500 errors via `api/_error-alert.js` (requires `ERROR_ALERT_EMAIL` env var)
- **Setmore sync:** Ongoing import from Setmore booking system via REST API. Cron every 15 min (`api/setmore-sync.js`). Imports as real `lesson_bookings` with `created_by='setmore_sync'`. Pulls pickup addresses from customer profiles. Idempotent via `setmore_key`. Both systems run in parallel during transition.

# Coach Carter — Website Development Roadmap

## Overview

This document tracks the development of the **Coach Carter driving school platform** — a comprehensive web application for booking lessons, processing payments, tracking learner competency, and providing AI-powered learning tools. The platform includes a learner portal, instructor portal, admin portal, Stripe-integrated payments (with Klarna), a DL25-aligned 17-skill competency framework, AI chat features powered by Claude, and full Progressive Web App (PWA) support for installable, offline-capable access.

---

## Phase 1: Booking & Payment System ✅ Complete

### 1.1 — Lesson Credits & Payments ✅

**How it works:**
Learners purchase lesson credits through the website. Each credit equals one 1.5-hour lesson. Payments are processed through Stripe, with Klarna available as a payment method for spreading the cost. Bulk discount tiers apply automatically based on quantity.

**Key decisions:**
- Lesson length: **1.5 hours** (fixed, single slot type for now)
- Base price: **£82.50 per credit**
- Bulk discounts applied at checkout:
  - 4 credits (6hrs) → 5% off
  - 8 credits (12hrs) → 10% off
  - 12 credits (18hrs) → 15% off
  - 16 credits (24hrs) → 20% off
  - 20 credits (30hrs) → 25% off
- Credits are **refundable**
- Credits are stored as a balance on the learner's account

**What was built:**
- ✅ `api/credits.js` — balance lookup and Stripe checkout with bulk discount logic
- ✅ `api/webhook.js` — updated to handle `credit_purchase` payments, writes to Neon DB atomically
- ✅ `public/learner/buy-credits.html` — quantity selector, discount tier cards, live price breakdown, Klarna note
- ✅ Confirmation email to learner on successful purchase
- ✅ Klarna enabled (payment methods inherited from Stripe dashboard)

---

### 1.2 — Instructor Availability & Calendar ✅

**How it works:**
Each instructor has recurring weekly availability windows. The system automatically divides these into bookable 1.5-hour slots. Booked slots are removed from the calendar in real time.

**Key decisions:**
- Calendar is **custom-built** (no third-party dependency)
- Learners can book **any available instructor**, not just a specific one
- Booking is **instant confirmation** — no instructor approval needed
- Learners can book up to **3 months in advance**
- **48-hour cancellation policy** — cancellations with 48+ hours notice automatically return the credit

**What was built:**
- ✅ `api/instructors.js` — instructor CRUD + weekly availability window management (admin-protected)
- ✅ `api/slots.js` — slot generation engine, booking, cancellation, and my-bookings endpoints
- ✅ `public/learner/book.html` — week-by-week calendar UI, instructor filter, booking confirmation modal, cancellation modal with 48-hour policy display
- ✅ Confirmation emails to both learner and instructor on booking and cancellation
- ✅ 48-hour cancellation policy enforced server-side with automatic credit return
- ✅ Race condition protection via DB unique index on instructor/date/time

---

### 1.3 — Data Model ✅

All tables live in **Neon (PostgreSQL)**. Migration file: `db/migrations/001_booking_system.sql`.

**`learner_users`** *(extended)*
- Added: `credit_balance` (integer, DB constraint prevents negative), `phone`

**`instructors`**
- Name, email, phone, bio, photo URL, active flag

**`instructor_availability`**
- Recurring weekly windows per instructor (day_of_week 0–6, start_time, end_time)

**`lesson_bookings`**
- Learner → Instructor link, date/time (90 min enforced at DB level)
- Status: confirmed / completed / cancelled
- Tracks whether credit was returned on cancellation
- Unique index prevents double-booking a slot

**`credit_transactions`**
- Full audit trail: type (purchase/refund/slot_purchase), credits, amount in pence, payment method, Stripe IDs

**`slot_reservations`**
- Holds slots during Stripe Checkout (10-minute TTL)
- instructor_id, scheduled_date, start_time, end_time, learner_id, stripe_session_id, expires_at
- Excluded from availability results; cleaned up after payment or expiry

**`magic_link_tokens`**
- Token, email, phone, method (email/sms), expires_at (15 min), used flag
- Two-step verification: validate (GET, read-only) then verify (POST, consumes token)

---

### 1.4 — User Flows ✅

**Learner purchases credits:**
1. Learner logs in → navigates to "Buy Credits"
2. Selects quantity (discount tier cards highlight applicable discount)
3. Pays via Stripe (card or Klarna)
4. Stripe webhook confirms payment → credits added to balance, confirmation email sent

**Learner books a lesson (has credits):**
1. Learner logs in → opens booking calendar (`/learner/book.html`)
2. Browses available slots week by week (filter by instructor optional)
3. Clicks a slot → confirmation modal shows date, time, instructor, credit cost
4. Confirms → 1 credit deducted, booking confirmed, both parties emailed

**Learner books a lesson (no credits — pay per slot):**
1. Learner opens booking calendar with 0 credits
2. Banner shows: "No lessons on your account. No worries — you can pay when you book, or buy a bundle to save."
3. Clicks a slot → modal shows "Pay £82.50 & book" path instead of credit deduction
4. Clicks pay → slot reserved for 10 minutes, redirected to Stripe Checkout (£82.50)
5. Stripe webhook confirms payment → 1 credit added + immediately deducted, booking confirmed, both parties emailed with .ics calendar attachment
6. If payment cancelled or abandoned → reservation expires after 10 minutes, slot released back to calendar

**Learner cancels a lesson:**
1. Learner views upcoming bookings at top of calendar page
2. Clicks Cancel → modal shows whether credit will be returned (48hr check)
3. If 48+ hours before lesson → credit returned automatically
4. If under 48 hours → credit forfeited, learner informed of policy

- ✅ Renamed `api/update-statis.js` → `api/update-status.js` to match frontend API calls

### 2.2 — Instructor Self-Service Portal ✅ Complete

Instructors can log in, view their own schedule, mark lessons complete, and manage their availability and profile — without needing admin access.

**What was built:**

- ✅ `db/migrations/003_calendar_token.sql` — `calendar_token` column on `learner_users`, indexed for fast polling
- ✅ Feed URL exposed to learners via `GET /api/calendar?action=feed-url`

### 2.3b — Inbound iCal Feed Sync ✅ Complete

Instructors can paste their personal calendar's iCal feed URL (Google, Outlook, Apple) into their profile page. A cron job polls feeds every 15 minutes and stores busy-time blocks. Slot generation checks these events alongside bookings and blackout dates — overlapping slots are automatically blocked for learners. No OAuth; works with any calendar provider.

**What was built:**
- ✅ `db/migrations/022_ical_sync.sql` — `instructor_external_events` table + `ical_feed_url`, `ical_last_synced_at`, `ical_sync_error` columns on `instructors`
- ✅ `api/ical-sync.js` — Vercel cron job (every 15 min), processes 1 instructor per invocation, expands RRULE recurring events, upserts via uid_hash dedup

### 2.5 — Pay-Per-Slot Booking ✅ Complete

Allow learners with 0 credits to pay for a single lesson at the point of booking instead of requiring them to buy credits first.

**What was built:**
- ✅ Dual-path booking modal — detects credit balance and shows either "Confirm booking" (use credit) or "Pay £82.50 & book" (Stripe Checkout)
- ✅ `api/slots.js` `checkout-slot` action — creates Stripe Checkout session with `payment_type: 'slot_booking'` metadata
- ✅ Slot reservation system — `slot_reservations` table holds slot for 10 minutes during payment, excluded from availability
- ✅ `api/webhook.js` `handleSlotBooking` — processes payment, atomically adds/deducts credit, creates booking, sends .ics calendar attachment to both parties

Fixed magic link login — email clients were pre-fetching the verify link and consuming the token before the learner clicked it. Applied to both learner and instructor logins.

**What was built:**
- ✅ New `validate` endpoint (GET) — lightweight token check that does NOT mark it as used
- ✅ `verify` endpoint changed to POST-only — only browser JavaScript can consume the token
- ✅ `public/learner/verify.html` — two-step flow: validate (GET) then verify (POST)
- ✅ `api/instructor.js` — new `validate-token` (GET) + `verify-token` changed to POST-only

- ✅ `public/shared/learner-auth.js` — `ccAuth.getAuth()`, `ccAuth.logout()`, `ccAuth.requireAuth()`, `ccAuth.getToken()`
- ✅ `public/shared/instructor-auth.js` — same API for instructor portal
- ✅ Updated 13 learner pages and 5 instructor pages to use shared CSS (~984 lines of duplicated CSS removed)
- ✅ Updated 13 learner pages and 5 instructor pages to use shared auth JS (inline localStorage reads/logout functions replaced with `ccAuth` calls)

**Part 3: Email Error Alerts**
- ✅ `api/_error-alert.js` — fire-and-forget `reportError()` utility using existing SMTP config
- ✅ Added `reportError()` before every `res.status(500)` call across 21 API files
- ✅ Sends formatted email with endpoint, error message, and stack trace
- ✅ Requires `ERROR_ALERT_EMAIL` env var (silently no-ops if not set)
- ✅ Non-blocking — does not await, does not slow error responses

### 2.36 — Multiple Lesson Types & Hours-Based Balance ✅ Complete (31 March 2026)

Replaced fixed 90-min/1-credit lessons with variable-duration lesson types and an hours-based balance system.

**What was built:**
- ✅ `lesson_types` table with admin CRUD API (`api/lesson-types.js`)
- ✅ Seeded: Standard Lesson (90min/£82.50), 2-Hour Lesson (120min/£110)
- ✅ `balance_minutes` column on learner_users — hours-based balance (stored as minutes internally)
- ✅ Existing credit balances migrated: `balance_minutes = credit_balance × 90`
- ✅ `lesson_type_id` + `minutes_deducted` on lesson_bookings for audit trail
- ✅ Slot generation engine (`api/slots.js`) accepts `lesson_type_id` for variable-duration slots
- ✅ All booking flows (book, checkout-slot, cancel, reschedule) use minutes-based balance
- ✅ `api/credits.js` sells hours at £55/hr with discount tiers (6/12/18/24/30 hrs)
- ✅ Webhook dual-writes `credit_balance` + `balance_minutes` for rollback safety
- ✅ Admin portal: Lesson Types CRUD management section
- ✅ Learner booking page: lesson type selector (shown when multiple types exist)
- ✅ Buy Credits → Buy Hours page with hour-based packages
- ✅ Dashboard, sidebar, emails, WhatsApp, ICS all show hours instead of credits

### 2.38 — Agenda/List View ✅ Complete (31 March 2026)

Fourth calendar view mode for instructors showing a scrollable list of upcoming lessons.

**What was built:**
- ✅ "Agenda" button in instructor calendar toolbar alongside Daily/Weekly/Monthly
- ✅ 14-day rolling window of bookings grouped by date headers
- ✅ Each card: time, colour-coded lesson type badge, learner name, pickup address, status
- ✅ Date headers clickable to drill into daily view
- ✅ Respects showCancelled toggle
- ✅ Cards open existing booking detail modal
- ✅ ±14 day navigation, Today button works

### 2.39 — Learner Dashboard Navigation Hub ✅ Complete (31 March 2026)

Redesigned learner dashboard as a navigation hub focused on learning, not upselling.

**What was built:**
- ✅ 5 quick-action buttons: Mock Test, Ask Examiner, Book Lessons, Progress, Quiz
- ✅ Removed "Hours Remaining" credit balance card (felt like upselling, not learner-focused)
- ✅ Upcoming lessons section retained
- ✅ Profile completion card simplified to 2 steps only: Prior Experience + Initial Assessment
- ✅ Profile card CTA copy adapts: "Add Your Experience" or "Complete Skill Assessment" based on next step

### 2.40 — Navigation Alignment: Desktop Groups + Fixed Mobile Tabs ✅ Complete (31 March 2026)

Aligned desktop and mobile navigation so both surfaces share the same mental model of sections and subsections.

**What was built:**
- ✅ Desktop sidebar: Lessons, Practice, Learn now expand as collapsible groups (accordion — one open at a time) revealing subsection links. Auto-expands to current section on page load.
- ✅ Mobile bottom bar: replaced contextual tabs that changed per-section with 5 fixed tabs (Home, Lessons, Practice, Learn, Profile) — consistent muscle memory across all pages
- ✅ Mobile header hamburger restored so users can access the sidebar on mobile (previously hidden when bottom bar was present)
- ✅ Active tab on mobile highlights based on `activeOn` mapping — e.g. visiting `/learner/mock-test.html` lights up the Practice tab
- ✅ Single file change: `public/sidebar.js` only

### 2.41 — UI/Design Refresh: Borderless Cards + App-Style Polish ✅ Complete (31 March 2026)

Mobbin-inspired visual refresh across the learner and instructor portals, bringing the aesthetic closer to top iOS apps (Revolut, Calm, Freenow, komoot).

**What was built:**
- ✅ Cards site-wide: removed all `border: 1px solid` from `.card`, `.choice-card`, `.quick-action-card`, `.stat-pill`, `.progress-card`, `.upcoming-card`, `.profile-card`, `.cal-sync-banner` — replaced with neutral ambient shadows
- ✅ Upcoming lesson cards retain the orange left-border accent, all others are fully borderless
- ✅ `.choice-card` hover: removed border-colour change, now uses shadow depth only
- ✅ Bottom tab active state: warm pill highlight (`#fff4ec` background) instead of orange text alone
- ✅ Changes via CSS injection in `sidebar.js` — no edits to individual page files
- ✅ `public/shared-auth.css` updated for login/choice card styles

### 2.42 — Instructor Calendar: Timepage-Style Weekly View ✅ Complete (31 March 2026)

Replaced the time-grid weekly view (which crushed columns on mobile) with an agenda-style layout inspired by Timepage.

**What was built:**
- ✅ Each day is a horizontal row: compact day label (DOW + date number) on the left, lesson cards on the right
- ✅ Lesson cards have a coloured left-bar matching the lesson type colour
- ✅ Today's day label is highlighted in orange
- ✅ Empty days show "No lessons" placeholder
- ✅ Tap day label → drills into daily view; tap lesson card → opens booking detail modal
- ✅ Preserves: cancelled/completed styling, `hideWeekends` filter, `showCancelled` toggle, lesson type colours
- ✅ Scales naturally to any screen width — no more crushed columns on mobile
- ✅ Changes in `public/instructor/index.html` only (CSS + `renderWeekly()` function)

### 2.43 — Floating Pill Bottom Nav Bar ✅ Complete (31 March 2026)

Replaced the edge-to-edge fixed bottom bar with a floating pill — matching the premium app style of Revolut, Linear, and top iOS apps.

**What was built:**
- ✅ Bar floats 12px above the bottom edge with 10px side margins (not full-width)
- ✅ `border-radius: 26px` — fully rounded pill shape
- ✅ `backdrop-filter: blur(20px)` frosted glass effect on the bar background
- ✅ Layered shadow (`0 8px 32px` + `0 2px 8px`) for depth
- ✅ Subtle `1px border` at `rgba(0,0,0,0.06)` for edge definition
- ✅ Inactive tabs: lighter grey `#a0a0a0`; active: orange icon + warm `#fff3e8` pill
- ✅ Active icon scales 1.1× with bolder stroke (2.5)
- ✅ Home tab: switched from dashboard/grid icon to house icon
- ✅ Safe area inset handled via `max(12px, env(safe-area-inset-bottom))`
- ✅ Content height updated from 72px to 80px to account for floating offset

### 2.44 — Dashboard Redesign: Hero Cards, Pills & Action Cards ✅ Complete (1 April 2026)

Replaced the top section of both learner and instructor dashboards with an app-style layout inspired by Klarna, Zing, and Monday.com. Prioritises answering "when's my next lesson?" and reducing clutter.

**What was built (Learner — `public/learner/index.html`):**
- ✅ Compact greeting (`Hi, {name}`) replacing the old welcome banner + subtitle
- ✅ **Next Lesson hero card** — orange gradient card showing next upcoming lesson: date, time, instructor, countdown ("In 3 hours", "Tomorrow"), plus 52px readiness ring (white-on-orange)
- ✅ Dashed empty state with "Book a Lesson" CTA when no lessons exist
- ✅ **Quick Access Pills** — horizontal scrollable row of 5 circular icon shortcuts (Progress, Videos, Quiz, Examiner AI, Log Session) with coloured backgrounds
- ✅ **Colour Action Cards** — 3-column grid: Book Lesson (orange gradient), Buy Credits (green gradient), Mock Test (blue gradient)
- ✅ Upcoming section now shows 2nd+ lessons (1st is in hero card); hidden when 0–1 lessons
- ✅ Calendar sync banner moved outside upcoming section so it always shows
- ✅ Inline SVG icons throughout (no emojis)

**What was built (Instructor — `public/instructor/index.html`):**
- ✅ Compact greeting (`Hi, {first name}`)
- ✅ **Next Lesson hero card** — same orange gradient style, shows countdown ("In 45m"), learner name, pickup address, phone. Right side shows today's lesson count stat bubble
- ✅ Empty state with "Add a Lesson" CTA
- ✅ **Quick Access Pills** — Learners (blue), Earnings (green), Availability (purple), Q&A (orange), Profile (grey)
- ✅ **Colour Action Cards** — Add Lesson (orange), Set Availability (purple), View Earnings (green)
- ✅ Glance stats row moved below new section
- ✅ Print CSS updated to exclude new elements

**Key decisions:**
- Reused existing API data (`BOOKINGS_DATA.upcoming[0]` for learner, `bookingCache` for instructor) — no new endpoints
- Pills are "browse" shortcuts; action cards are primary CTAs — separates discovery from doing
- Hidden scrollbar on pill row for clean mobile swipe
- Action cards collapse to horizontal scroll only below 340px (not 380px, so standard iPhone widths get the grid)

### 2.45 — Learner Weekly Availability + Waiting List ✅ Complete (1 April 2026)

Two companion features: learners declare their typical free times, and a waitlist notifies them when matching slots open via cancellation.

**What was built:**
- ✅ `learner_availability` table — mirrors `instructor_availability` (day_of_week + time range), max 14 windows per learner
- ✅ `waitlist` table — optional day/time prefs, instructor, lesson type; status lifecycle (active → notified → booked/expired), 14-day auto-expiry
- ✅ `api/learner.js` — `my-availability` + `set-availability` actions (delete-and-insert, 30-min boundaries)
- ✅ `api/waitlist.js` — `join`, `my-waitlist`, `leave` actions + `checkWaitlistOnCancel()` internal function
- ✅ `api/slots.js` — cancellation hook: both single and series cancellations trigger waitlist matching (fire-and-forget)
- ✅ Profile page: "My Availability" card (day rows with time chips, add/remove, overlap detection) + "My Waitlist" card (entries with status badges, leave button)
- ✅ Booking page: "Notify me when a slot opens" button on empty state, inline form with day/time/instructor prefs or "match my availability" checkbox
- ✅ Notifications: WhatsApp + email to all matching learners when a slot frees up

**Key decisions:**
- Notify-all approach (not sequential) — existing `uq_instructor_slot` unique index + 10-min Stripe reservation prevents double-booking
- Waitlist matching uses two branches: explicit entry prefs OR learner_availability fallback (via EXISTS subquery)
- Auto-expiry on read (no cron) — stale entries expired in `checkWaitlistOnCancel` and `my-waitlist`
- Max 10 active waitlist entries per learner

---

## Phase 3: Next Up (Prioritised)

### 2.46 — Instructor Profile Enhancement ✅ Complete (1 April 2026)

Extended the instructor profile with qualifications, vehicle, service area, and languages — preparing for multi-school/multi-instructor support.

- **Qualifications & Experience** — ADI grade, pass rate %, years of experience, specialisms chip selector (8 options)
- **Vehicle** — make, model, transmission type (manual/automatic/both), dual controls toggle
- **Service Area** — comma-separated postcodes/areas, stored as JSONB for future geo-search
- **Languages** — comma-separated, JSONB array, defaults to English
- **DB**: 10 new columns on `instructors` table (JSONB arrays for specialisms, service_areas, languages)
- **API**: Extended `profile` GET and `update-profile` POST with validation
- **Files**: `db/migration.sql`, `api/instructor.js`, `public/instructor/profile.html`

---

### 2.47 — Instructor Portal Cleanup ✅ Complete (1 April 2026)

Bug fixes and UI cleanup across the instructor portal.

- **Fix**: Profile page JS parse error — backslash-backtick (`\``) in `loadBookingLinks` was a literal backslash+backtick, not a valid template literal. Replaced with string concatenation. Also extracted specialisms chip builder from nested template literal.
- **Fix**: Earnings page 500 error — `earnings-week` query referenced `instructor_notes` column that was missing from production DB (table created before column was added to schema; `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` skipped it). Removed unused column from query and added idempotent `ALTER TABLE`.
- **Fix**: Earnings page "Invalid Date" — Neon returns Postgres date columns as objects, not ISO strings. Added `toDateStr()` normalizer.
- **UI**: Removed redundant fixed header bar (CoachCarter branding + Sign out) from all 6 instructor pages. The sidebar already provides both. This was overlapping page content and blocking summary cards on earnings. Reduced page `margin-top` from 124px to 64px.
- **Files**: All 6 `public/instructor/*.html`, `api/instructor.js`, `db/migration.sql`

---

### 2.48 — Stripe Connect & Weekly Instructor Payouts ✅ Complete (1 April 2026)

Automated instructor payouts via Stripe Connect Express accounts. Learner payments land in the platform account as before, then instructor earnings are transferred every Friday via a Vercel cron job.

- **Stripe Connect Express** — instructors onboard via Stripe's hosted flow (self-service from earnings page or admin-triggered invite email)
- **Weekly cron job** (`api/cron-payouts.js`) — runs every Friday 9am UTC. Finds eligible bookings (completed OR confirmed 3+ days old), calculates instructor share (price × commission_rate), creates Stripe transfers, sends email notifications
- **Safety**: `UNIQUE(booking_id)` constraint on `payout_line_items` prevents double-payment even if cron and manual trigger fire simultaneously
- **Admin controls**: Payouts section in admin portal with connect status table, upcoming estimates, pause/resume toggle per instructor, manual "Process Payouts Now" trigger
- **Platform owner handling**: "Not needed" dismiss button for instructors who own the platform and don't need payouts (clears half-created accounts, hides banner permanently)
- **Webhook**: `account.updated` event auto-marks `stripe_onboarding_complete = TRUE` when instructor finishes Stripe onboarding
- **New files**: `api/connect.js` (6 actions), `api/cron-payouts.js`, `api/_payout-helpers.js`
- **New tables**: `instructor_payouts`, `payout_line_items`
- **New columns**: `instructors.stripe_account_id`, `instructors.stripe_onboarding_complete`, `instructors.payouts_paused`
- **Modified**: `api/instructor.js` (+2 actions), `api/admin.js` (+4 actions), `api/webhook.js`, `vercel.json`, `public/instructor/earnings.html`, `public/admin/portal.html`

### 2.49 — Fixed Weekly Franchise Fee Model ✅ Complete (2 April 2026)

Alternative billing model: instead of taking a percentage commission per lesson, the platform takes a fixed weekly franchise fee (e.g. £50/week or £200/week). The instructor keeps all lesson revenue minus the fee.

- **Two fee models** per instructor, configurable via admin portal dropdown: "Commission (%)" or "Franchise Fee (fixed weekly)"
- **New columns**: `instructors.weekly_franchise_fee_pence` (NULL = commission model), `instructor_payouts.franchise_fee_pence` (audit trail)
- **Payout logic**: franchise fee capped at weekly gross — instructor never goes negative
- **Earnings display**: franchise model shows gross/fee/net breakdown on weekly view; bottom note shows "Franchise fee: £X/week" instead of commission rate
- **Backward compatible**: NULL franchise fee = legacy commission_rate model (no existing behaviour changed)
- **Modified**: `api/_payout-helpers.js`, `api/instructor.js` (4 earnings endpoints), `api/admin.js`, `api/instructors.js`, `public/admin/portal.html`, `public/instructor/earnings.html`, `db/migration.sql`

---

### 3.1 — Push Notifications

PWA push notifications for lesson reminders, quiz nudges, and new message alerts.

### 3.2 — Automated Lesson Reminders

24-hour email/WhatsApp reminder to learner and instructor before each lesson. Needs Vercel cron job.

### 3.3 — Refund Flow

Learner requests cash refund from dashboard, admin approves in portal, Stripe processes reversal.

### 3.4 — Referral System

Unique referral link per learner. Both referrer and new learner receive hours bonus on first purchase.

### 3.5 — Recurring/Repeat Bookings

"Repeat weekly" option when booking — creates multiple bookings in one transaction. Depends on lesson types (Feature 3).

### 3.6 — Per-Service Booking Links

URL parameter support: `/learner/book?type=2hr` pre-selects lesson type. Shareable links for marketing.

### 3.7 — GDPR Full Compliance (3 April 2026)

Full GDPR compliance pass across the entire platform. Addresses cookie consent, data portability, right to erasure, data retention, and audit logging.

**What was built:**
- Cookie consent banner on all 35 HTML pages — PostHog analytics only loads after explicit user consent
- Data export API (`POST /api/learner?action=export-data`) — learners download all personal data as JSON
- User-initiated account deletion (`request-deletion` + `confirm-deletion`) — email-verified cascading delete
- Credit transactions anonymized (not deleted) for 7-year tax retention
- Data retention cron (`api/cron-retention.js`) — weekly, archives inactive learners >3 years, purges after 90 days
- Audit logging (`api/_audit.js`) — tracks admin data mutations (delete, adjust credits, instructor changes)
- Consent recording to DB with hashed IP for audit proof
- `last_activity_at` updates on login and booking for retention policy
- Privacy & Data section in learner profile (export, cookie preferences, delete account)
- Cookie Settings link in sidebar footer and landing page

**Files created:** `public/cookie-consent.js`, `public/posthog-loader.js`, `public/learner/confirm-deletion.html`, `api/cron-retention.js`, `api/_audit.js`
**Files modified:** 35 HTML files, `api/learner.js`, `api/admin.js`, `api/config.js`, `api/magic-link.js`, `api/slots.js`, `db/migration.sql`, `public/sidebar.js`, `public/learner/profile.html`, `vercel.json`
**DB:** 3 new tables (`cookie_consents`, `audit_log`, `deletion_requests`), 5 new columns, FK change on `credit_transactions`

### 3.8 — Database Security & Performance Hardening (3 April 2026)

Security hardening and query performance optimization across the entire platform.

**Security fixes:**
- Fixed SQL injection pattern — replaced dynamic table/column name interpolation with explicit parameterized queries in 3 files
- Added security headers to all responses via middleware.js (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy)
- Centralised CORS in middleware.js — restricted from `*` to coachcarter.uk/co.uk domains only, removed per-file CORS from 31 API files
- Rate limiting on magic link sends (5 per email/phone per hour) via `rate_limits` DB table
- Verified Neon SSL (`sslmode=require` + `channel_binding=require`) and connection pooling

**Performance — 28 new indexes:**
- FK indexes on lesson_bookings (learner_id, instructor_id, lesson_type_id), credit_transactions, driving_sessions, skill_ratings, quiz_results, mock_tests, qa_questions/answers, slot_reservations, instructor_learner_notes
- Composite indexes: (school_id, status, scheduled_date), (instructor_id, scheduled_date, start_time), (learner_id, status)
- Partial indexes on magic_link_tokens (email/phone WHERE NOT NULL)
- Medium priority: lesson_confirmations, sent_reminders, lesson_offers, instructor_availability, admin_users

**Also in this session:**
- Replaced JSON data export download with readable "My Data" page (`/learner/my-data.html`) matching privacy/terms page style
- Profile page: Export button replaced with subtle text links (View my data · Cookie preferences · Privacy policy)
- Test data seed endpoint (`/api/seed-test-data`) creating 3 test accounts with realistic data for GDPR flow testing
- Updated privacy policy to platform model (CoachCarter as sole Data Controller for all schools)
- Cookie consent banner added to all 47 HTML pages (11 were missing initially)
- Fixed multiple column name mismatches in export queries (qa_questions, skill_ratings, quiz_results, mock_tests, learner_onboarding)

**Files created:** `api/seed-test-data.js`, `public/learner/my-data.html`
**Files modified:** `middleware.js`, `api/admin.js`, `api/learner.js`, `api/cron-retention.js`, `api/magic-link.js`, `db/migration.sql`, 31 API files (CORS removal), `public/privacy.html`, `public/learner/profile.html`, `CLAUDE.md`
**DB:** 1 new table (`rate_limits`), 28 new indexes, `last_activity_at` DEFAULT NOW()

---

### 3.9 — Dark Mode (4 April 2026)

System-wide dark mode support across all learner, instructor, admin, and public pages.

**How it works:**
- CSS custom properties in `learner.css`, `instructor.css`, and `shared-auth.css` are overridden via `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` and a `.dark-mode` class on `:root`
- Dark palette uses dark greys (#1a1a1a body, #242424 surface, #2e2e2e cards) rather than pure black — matches existing #262626 brand colour
- Orange accent (#f58321) stays the same in both modes
- Manual toggle on learner and instructor profile pages — stored in `localStorage` key `cc_dark_mode` (values: `auto`, `light`, `dark`)
- `public/shared/dark-mode.js` loaded on every page before DOM renders to prevent flash of wrong theme
- Skeleton shimmer uses CSS variables instead of hardcoded greys
- Sidebar, bottom nav, and mobile header all use CSS variables for dark mode compatibility

**What was built:**
- Dark mode CSS variable overrides in `learner.css`, `instructor.css`, `shared-auth.css`
- `public/shared/dark-mode.js` — theme toggle logic, localStorage persistence, system preference detection, theme-color meta tag updates
- Theme selector dropdown in sidebar footer (above Sign Out button), available on every page for both logged-in and logged-out users
- Converted hardcoded colours (#fff, #f9f9f9, #262626, #e0e0e0, #797879) to CSS variables across 27 HTML inline style blocks
- Converted sidebar.js hardcoded colours to CSS variable fallback pattern

**Files created:** `public/shared/dark-mode.js`
**Files modified:** `public/shared/learner.css`, `public/shared/instructor.css`, `public/shared-auth.css`, `public/sidebar.js`, 48 HTML files (dark-mode.js script tag + inline colour variable conversion)

### UX Cleanup — Learner Booking & Instructor Portal (4 April 2026)

Major UX declutter across 8 pages, removing 1,123 lines of duplicate navigation, cluttered banners, and orange overload.

**Learner booking page (`book.html`) + buy-credits:**
- Removed old `.site-nav`, `.sub-tabs`, `.bottom-nav` (sidebar.js handles all nav)
- Replaced full upcoming bookings strip with compact "Next lesson" card + "View all" link
- Grouped slot feed by date headers instead of repeating date on every card
- Toned down orange: neutral pills/card hover/banners, accent only on primary CTAs
- Merged lesson type pills + instructor filter into one sticky toolbar row
- Removed redundant "Book a Lesson" title heading and calendar sync banner

**Instructor portal (all 6 pages):**
- Removed old `.site-nav` and `.bottom-nav` from availability, earnings, learners, qa, profile, index
- Removed duplicated `.bottom-nav` CSS from each page's style block

**Instructor dashboard redesign:**
- Created new `/instructor/dashboard.html` — compact no-scroll view of today's lessons
- Shows greeting, inline stats strip ("3 today · 12 this week"), today's lesson list
- Next upcoming lesson highlighted with accent left-border; completed lessons muted
- "Book Lesson" button with learner search modal (reuses create-booking API)
- Removed pill-row, action-cards, orange gradient hero card, calendar sync banner from calendar page
- Calendar page (`/instructor/index.html`) is now pure calendar with sticky toolbar

**Navigation update:**
- Instructor bottom tabs: Dashboard | Calendar | Learners | Earnings | Profile (was: Calendar | Learners | Earnings | Q&A | Profile)
- Q&A moved to sidebar-only (not removed, just deprioritised from bottom tabs)
- Dashboard added as first sidebar item

**Files changed:** `sidebar.js`, `public/instructor/dashboard.html` (new), `public/instructor/index.html`, `public/instructor/availability.html`, `public/instructor/earnings.html`, `public/instructor/learners.html`, `public/instructor/qa.html`, `public/instructor/profile.html`, `public/learner/book.html`, `public/learner/buy-credits.html`

---

## Phase 4: Future Considerations (Not Yet Scoped)

- ~~**T&Cs acceptance on login** — add checkbox to magic link login flow ("I agree to Terms & Privacy Policy"), record acceptance with timestamp in DB. Also update terms.html to platform model language.~~ ✅ Done (2.54)
- **Capacitor native wrapper** — wrap PWA for App Store / Play Store submission
- ~~**Instructor dashboard** — earnings tracking, lesson stats, learner progress overview~~ ✅ Done (2.48)
- **Theory test prep** — built-in revision tools integrated with competency system
- **Multi-instructor scaling** — instructor-specific pricing, rating system (specialisations done in 2.46)
- **Automated progress reports** — weekly email digest with competency changes and recommendations
- **Parent/guardian view** — read-only progress access for parents of younger learners
- **Intensive course packages** — multi-day bundled bookings with special pricing

---

## 2.50 — Setmore Booking Sync (April 2026)

**What:** Ongoing sync from Setmore (third-party booking system) into CoachCarter's built-in booking system. Both systems run in parallel during the transition.

**Built:**
- `api/setmore-sync.js` — cron every 15 min, imports Setmore appointments as real `lesson_bookings`
- OAuth2 auth via `SETMORE_REFRESH_TOKEN` env var
- Auto-creates/matches learner accounts by phone number or email
- Idempotent via `setmore_key` unique index on `lesson_bookings`
- Service mapping strips Setmore's built-in 30-min buffer from lesson durations
- Resolves correct instructor from each appointment's `staff_key`
- 3 new lesson types: 3-Hour Lesson (active), 1-Hour Lesson (inactive), Free Trial (inactive)
- ✅ Cancellation detection — marks bookings as cancelled when Setmore appointments are cancelled or removed
- ✅ `api/setmore-welcome.js` — daily cron sends one-time welcome email with 7-day magic link to Setmore-created learners
- ✅ `api/_travel-time.js` — travel time check between pickup postcodes using OpenRouteService, integrated into booking flow as a warning
- ✅ Pickup address import — pulls address from Setmore customer profile (`address`, `city`, `postal_code`) into `lesson_bookings.pickup_address`, with backfill for existing bookings
- ✅ "Slots hidden" banner on `book.html` — shows learners how many slots were filtered by travel distance
- ✅ Admin `max_travel_minutes` setting — per-instructor travel threshold editable from admin portal instructor form

**Transition plan:** New bookings through CoachCarter, existing Setmore clients migrate gradually, then remove sync.

## 2.51 — Pickup Address & Buy Lesson Types (2 April 2026)

**What:** Improve the travel-time slot filtering UX and give learners a choice of lesson types when purchasing.

**Built:**
- ✅ Pickup postcode prompt on `book.html` — inline input above calendar for learners without a `pickup_address`, saves to profile via existing `update_profile` API, then re-fetches slots with travel filter active. Non-blocking.
- ✅ Learner address backfill in `setmore-sync.js` — step 5d copies the most recent booking's `pickup_address` to `learner_users.pickup_address` when the learner's profile field is empty. Scoped per-instructor, idempotent.
- ✅ Single lesson type cards on `buy-credits.html` — dynamically fetched from `/api/lesson-types`, each card shows name, duration, price, and colour-coded Buy button. "Or save with hour packages" divider separates from bulk discounts.
- ✅ Test Ready Guarantee section temporarily hidden (`display:none`) pending review.

**Files changed:** `public/learner/book.html`, `public/learner/buy-credits.html`, `api/setmore-sync.js`

## 2.52 — "Next Available" Slot Feed (3 April 2026)

**What:** Replace the weekly/monthly/daily time-grid calendar on the booking page with a clean "next available" feed. Learners see only available slots, sorted by date+time — no empty hours or empty days.

**Built:**
- ✅ Slot feed — flat scrollable list of slot cards showing date, time, instructor, lesson type colour. No grid, no timeline.
- ✅ Sticky lesson type pill bar — compact pills below the header (`position: sticky`), always visible while scrolling. Shows type name, duration, price.
- ✅ Progressive loading — 14 days at a time with "Show more slots" button (up to 90 days).
- ✅ Removed ~500 lines of old calendar CSS/JS: 3 renderers (monthly/weekly/daily), view toggle, date navigation arrows, cursor state, drillToDay.
- ✅ Admin adjust-credits fix — transaction log INSERT made best-effort so balance updates succeed even if the log fails.
- ✅ Postcode save fix — corrected action name (`update_profile` → `update-profile`).

**Files changed:** `public/learner/book.html`, `api/admin.js`

## 2.53 — Instructor Blackout Date Ranges (3 April 2026)

**What:** Instructors can now block out a date range (start + end date) instead of adding one day at a time. Ideal for holidays or extended time off.

**Built:**
- ✅ DB migration — added `end_date` column to `instructor_blackout_dates`, backfills existing single-day rows, new composite index
- ✅ API — GET `blackout-dates` returns `start_date` + `end_date`; POST `set-blackout-dates` accepts `{ ranges: [{ start_date, end_date, reason }] }` with overlap + max 365-day validation
- ✅ Slot filtering — range overlap query in `slots.js`, expands ranges into per-day Set entries (slot generation loop unchanged)
- ✅ UI — two date pickers (start/end), end auto-follows start, overlap check on add, ranges display as "Mon 3 Apr – Fri 7 Apr 2026" with day count badge

**Files changed:** `db/migration.sql`, `api/instructor.js`, `api/slots.js`, `public/instructor/availability.html`

## 2.54 — Terms & Conditions Acceptance (4 April 2026)

**What:** Learners must accept Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy before accessing the dashboard. Gate appears after magic link login (both email and SMS flows). Also updated terms.html to use platform language consistent with privacy.html.

**Built:**
- ✅ DB — `terms_accepted_at TIMESTAMPTZ` column on `learner_users`
- ✅ API — `POST /api/learner?action=accept-terms` sets timestamp
- ✅ Magic link verify/verify-code responses now include `terms_accepted` boolean
- ✅ Frontend gate — new screen in `login.html` with checkbox ("I agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy") shown after successful auth when `terms_accepted` is false. New users always see it after name collection.
- ✅ GDPR — `terms_accepted_at` included in `export-data` response. No deletion cascade change needed (column on `learner_users` which is already deleted).
- ✅ `terms.html` rewritten with platform language — CoachCarter as platform operator, driving schools as service providers. Added "Platform and services" and "Your data and privacy" sections.

**Files changed:** `db/migration.sql`, `api/magic-link.js`, `api/learner.js`, `public/learner/login.html`, `public/terms.html`, `PROJECT.md`

## 2.55 — PWA Enhancement Audit (4 April 2026)

**What:** Comprehensive PWA audit against modern best practices. Used a pwa-enhance skill to detect issues and generate a prioritised roadmap (`PWA_ROADMAP.md`). Implemented 13 of 15 items.

**Built:**
- ✅ Non-blocking Google Fonts — `preload` + `media="print"` swap pattern on all 47 HTML files. Mobile FCP expected to drop from 2.9s → ~1.5s
- ✅ Manifest `id` field — stable app identity decoupled from start_url
- ✅ Manifest `screenshots` — 2 mobile + 1 desktop screenshot for richer Android install UI
- ✅ Manifest `shortcuts` — Book a Lesson, My Progress, Practice Log (long-press quick actions)
- ✅ `overscroll-behavior: none` on body in shared CSS — prevents rubber-banding and pull-to-refresh in standalone mode
- ✅ Content Security Policy header (report-only) in `middleware.js` — covers Stripe, PostHog, fonts, CDNs, Cloudflare Stream
- ✅ Service worker update flow — removed auto-`skipWaiting()`, added `SKIP_WAITING` message pattern + user-facing update banner
- ✅ Cache size limits — max 100 items with `trimCache()`, `navigator.storage.persist()` request
- ✅ `system-ui` font fallback in `--font-head` and `--font-body` CSS variables
- ✅ Install banner + update banner safe-area padding (`env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`)
- ✅ Bottom nav context menu prevention (`-webkit-touch-callout: none` + `contextmenu` event)
- ✅ Skeleton shimmer loading states on dashboard, booking page, and progress page

**Not implemented (documented in PWA_ROADMAP.md):**
- Dark mode (`prefers-color-scheme` + manual toggle) — large cross-file effort, planned for next session
- Background Sync for offline form submissions — low priority for this app's use case

**Lighthouse scores (mobile, pre-change):** Performance 90 | Accessibility 96 | Best Practices 96 | SEO 100

**Files changed:** `public/manifest.json`, `public/sw.js`, `public/pwa.js`, `public/sidebar.js`, `middleware.js`, `public/shared/learner.css`, `public/shared/instructor.css`, `public/learner/index.html`, `public/learner/book.html`, `public/learner/progress.html`, all 47 HTML files (font loading), `public/icons/screenshot-*.png` (new), `PWA_ROADMAP.md` (new)

## 2.56 — Learner Upcoming Lessons Page & Instructor Lesson Detail Modal (4 April 2026)

**What changed:**

1. **Learner upcoming lessons page (`/learner/lessons.html`)** — replaced the redirect-only page with a full lessons view. Shows upcoming and past lessons in tabbed view, grouped by date. Each card displays time, instructor, lesson type with colour accent, duration, and pickup address. Actions: Add to Calendar (ICS download), Reschedule (48hr+ away, max 2 per chain), Cancel (with full 48hr policy modal). Series bookings grouped with "Cancel series" option. Empty state links to booking page.

2. **Instructor dashboard lesson detail modal** — tapping a lesson on the instructor dashboard now opens a detail modal instead of navigating to the calendar. Shows learner name, phone (tel: link), email, pickup/drop-off addresses, lesson type, duration, status, booking notes, and "prefer contact before" flag. Instructor can add notes and mark lessons as complete (past lessons only) or cancel (future lessons). Dashboard auto-refreshes after actions.

**Files changed:** `public/learner/lessons.html`, `public/instructor/dashboard.html`

## 2.57 — Running Late Notification (4 April 2026)

**What changed:**

1. **Running late button on instructor dashboard** — new "Running Late" button in the dashboard header alongside "+ Book Lesson". Opens a modal with preset delay options (10/15/20/30 min) and a custom input field. Shows how many learners will be notified. Button is disabled when there are no upcoming lessons today, auto-updates as lessons are completed or cancelled.

2. **Running late API action (`POST /api/instructor?action=running-late`)** — accepts `{ delay_minutes }`, queries today's remaining confirmed bookings where start_time is after the current time, sends WhatsApp (Twilio) and email to each learner with a personalised message including the lesson time and delay estimate. Returns `{ ok, notified }` count.

**Files changed:** `api/instructor.js`, `public/instructor/dashboard.html`

## 2.58 — Unauthenticated Booking Page Enhancements (5 April 2026)

**What changed:**

1. **Instructor filter and lesson type pills for unauthenticated users** — the booking page now loads the instructor dropdown and lesson type pill bar for visitors who aren't logged in. Previously these only loaded after authentication, leaving guests with an empty "All instructors" dropdown.

2. **Instructor-specific booking links (`?instructor=X`)** — booking page accepts an `instructor` URL parameter to pre-filter slots to a single instructor. Combined with `?type=` for full control (e.g. `?instructor=4&type=standard`). Instructor profile page now shows a "Your booking page" link at the top of the Booking Links section with per-lesson-type variants that include the instructor ID.

**Files changed:** `public/learner/book.html`, `public/instructor/profile.html`

---

## 2.59 — Guest Checkout (5 April 2026)

**What changed:**

1. **Guest booking without account** — learners can now book and pay for lessons without creating an account first. When an unauthenticated user clicks a slot, the booking modal shows guest fields (name, email, phone, pickup address, terms checkbox) instead of requiring login. The API creates the learner account immediately before Stripe payment so the existing webhook handler works unchanged.

2. **New API action (`POST /api/slots?action=checkout-slot-guest`)** — unauthenticated endpoint that validates guest fields, finds-or-creates a learner account by email (backfills empty fields on existing accounts), reserves the slot with the real learner_id, and creates a Stripe Checkout session. Rate limited: 10 per IP per hour + 5 per phone per hour.

3. **Modal scroll fix** — added `max-height` and `overflow-y: auto` to the booking modal so the guest form doesn't push buttons off-screen on mobile viewports.

**Files changed:** `api/slots.js`, `public/learner/book.html`

---

## 2.60 — Inline Profile Completion in Booking Modal (6 April 2026)

**What changed:**

1. **Profile fields in booking modal** — logged-in users who haven't set their phone number or pickup address now see those fields inline in the booking modal instead of being blocked with a "go update your profile" error. Details are saved to their profile automatically before the booking proceeds. Only missing fields are shown — if they already have a phone number, only pickup address appears.

**Files changed:** `public/learner/book.html`

---

## 2.61 — Sub-Tab Navigation for Mobile Sections (6 April 2026)

**What changed:**

1. **Sub-tab pill bar** — pages within sidebar groups (Lessons, Practice, Learn) now show a horizontal pill bar below the mobile header for navigating between sub-pages. Previously users had to open the hamburger sidebar to switch between e.g. Book / Buy Credits / Upcoming within the Lessons section. Built into `sidebar.js` and auto-generated from the existing nav config.

2. **Videos removed from Learn navigation** — Videos page hidden from sidebar and bottom tab. Learn tab now defaults to Examiner AI. Page code retained for future re-enablement.

**Files changed:** `public/sidebar.js`

---

## 2.62 — Bug Fixes: Instructor Cancel, Lesson Types Admin, Sidebar (6 April 2026)

**What changed:**

1. **Instructor cancel-booking fix** — the refund query used non-existent `credits` column instead of `credit_balance`, causing every instructor cancellation to fail with a 500 error. Now correctly returns `balance_minutes` and `credit_balance`, sets `credit_returned` and `cancelled_at` on the booking, and fetches `minutes_deducted` to return the correct amount.

2. **Admin lesson types fix** — lesson types section used undefined lowercase `token` instead of the admin portal's `HEADERS` constant. Load, save, and toggle lesson type actions were all broken.

3. **Sidebar sub-tabs fix** — `buildSubTabsHTML` referenced undefined `sections` variable instead of `navItems`. `preselectedTypeSlug` moved to module scope so `loadLessonTypes` can access it from the unauthenticated code path.

**Files changed:** `api/instructor.js`, `public/admin/portal.html`, `public/sidebar.js`, `public/learner/book.html`

---

## 2.63 — Admin Management of Instructor Blackout Dates (6 April 2026)

**What changed:**

1. **Admin blackout dates UI** — the Availability section of the admin portal now includes a "Blackout Dates" sub-section below the availability grid. When an instructor is selected, their blackout dates load automatically. Admins can add date ranges with optional reasons, remove individual blackouts, and save. Same validation as the instructor portal (no overlaps, max 365-day range).

2. **New admin API actions** — `GET /api/admin?action=instructor-blackouts&instructor_id=X` returns future blackout dates. `POST /api/admin?action=set-instructor-blackouts` with `{ instructor_id, ranges }` replaces all future blackout dates. Both use admin JWT auth.

**Files changed:** `api/admin.js`, `public/admin/portal.html`

---

## 2.64 — Booking Flow Audit & Instructor Booking Actions (6 April 2026)

**What changed:**

1. **Booking flow audit** — comprehensive code-level UX review of the end-to-end booking flow, resulting in `BOOKING-FLOW-AUDIT.md` with 24 items across P0–P3 priorities. 20 items implemented across 4 sprints.

2. **Shared instructor booking actions** — new `public/shared/instructor-booking-actions.js` module providing cancel, reschedule, and add-lesson modals used across instructor dashboard and calendar pages. Includes real-time conflict checking during reschedule.

3. **Various UX improvements** — auto-refresh fix, blackout save pattern, toast CSS, pre-lesson notes, styled modals replacing alert()/confirm(), default time inputs, guest validation, touch targets, retry buttons, reschedule count display, mobile toolbar overflow.

**Files changed:** `public/shared/instructor-booking-actions.js` (new), `api/admin.js`, `api/instructor.js`, `api/slots.js`, `public/admin/portal.html`, `public/instructor/*.html`, `public/learner/book.html`, `public/learner/buy-credits.html`, `public/learner/lessons.html`, `public/sidebar.js`

---

## 2.65 — Reschedule & Blackout Bug Fixes (7 April 2026)

**What changed:**

1. **Reschedule 500 fix** — the `lesson_bookings` status CHECK constraint didn't include `'rescheduled'`, causing every reschedule attempt to fail with a DB constraint violation. Added `'rescheduled'` to the CHECK constraint.

2. **Missing school_id in reschedule/create-booking INSERTs** — both learner and instructor reschedule handlers, plus instructor create-booking, were missing `school_id` in their INSERT statements. Added explicit `school_id` from JWT payload. Also improved unique constraint error detection with PostgreSQL error code `23505` fallback.

3. **Learner reschedule flow broken** — `book.html` never read the `?reschedule=BOOKING_ID` URL param from `lessons.html`, so reschedule mode was never activated. Now fetches booking details, pre-selects the instructor filter, and activates reschedule mode with the confirmation modal.

4. **Blackout date fallback** — the blackout query in slot generation silently failed if the `end_date` column was missing. Added fallback to single-date query with warning log.

5. **Calendar wording** — renamed "Subscribe"/"Sync" calendar buttons to "Auto-update your calendar" across learner booking page, dashboard, and demo page.

**Files changed:** `api/slots.js`, `api/instructor.js`, `db/migration.sql`, `public/learner/book.html`, `public/learner/index.html`, `public/demo/book.html`

## 2.66 — Launch Readiness Audit & Multi-tenant Fixes (7 April 2026)

**What changed:**

1. **Launch readiness audit** — ran a comprehensive 9-phase code-level audit covering security, accessibility, GDPR, SEO, performance, infrastructure, code quality, broken links, and data isolation. Overall score: 72% with 4 launch blockers (all LB-7: missing school_id filtering). Full report saved as `LAUNCH-AUDIT-REPORT.md`.

2. **Multi-tenant data isolation fixes (launch blockers):**
   - `api/instructors.js` — added `school_id` filter to public list endpoint, switched admin actions (create/update/set-availability) from local `verifyAdmin()` to centralised `requireAuth()`/`getSchoolId()` from `_auth.js`. Instructors are now scoped to their school.
   - `api/waitlist.js` — replaced local `verifyAuth()` with `requireAuth()` from `_auth.js`, added `school_id` filtering to all waitlist queries (join, my-waitlist, leave).
   - `api/qa-digest.js` — restructured from "send all questions to all instructors" to per-school processing. Questions grouped by `school_id`, each school's instructors only receive their own school's unanswered questions.
   - `api/reminders.js` — added cross-table `school_id` consistency JOINs (`lu.school_id = lb.school_id`, `i.school_id = lb.school_id`) to send-due, daily-schedule, and prompt-confirmations cron actions. Prevents cross-tenant data in reminder emails. Daily schedule now JOINs `schools` table for future branding use.

3. **Cookie consent school_id** — `api/config.js` record-consent action now includes `school_id` in the `cookie_consents` INSERT.

4. **CORS cleanup** — removed dead per-file CORS stubs from `api/availability.js`, `api/create-checkout-session.js`, `api/instructors.js`, `api/waitlist.js`, `api/reminders.js` (CORS handled centrally by `middleware.js`).

5. **SEO & infrastructure** — created `public/robots.txt` (blocks admin/portal/api paths), `public/sitemap.xml` (public-facing pages), and branded `public/404.html` error page.

**Files changed:** `api/instructors.js`, `api/waitlist.js`, `api/qa-digest.js`, `api/reminders.js`, `api/config.js`, `api/availability.js`, `api/create-checkout-session.js`, `public/robots.txt` (new), `public/sitemap.xml` (new), `public/404.html` (new), `LAUNCH-AUDIT-REPORT.md` (new), `.launch-audit-config.json` (new)

## 2.67 — Launch Audit Blocker Fixes (8 April 2026)

**What changed:**

1. **Security blockers (LB-3):** Added `requireAuth()` to `api/create-checkout-session.js` (learner/admin roles) and `api/availability.js` GET handler (admin only). These were unauthenticated endpoints handling sensitive data.

2. **Data isolation blockers (LB-7) — ~40 SQL queries fixed:** Added `school_id` filtering across `api/slots.js` (bookings, reservations, offers, blackouts, external events, learner/instructor lookups, getLessonType), `api/instructor.js` (Q&A queries, learner history, create booking, schedule range), `api/learner.js` (update-name, update-profile, contact-pref, unlogged-bookings, pending-confirmations, qa-ask INSERT), `api/admin.js` (booking/session subqueries in all-learners, learner-detail, adjust-credits INSERT, all-instructors), `api/enquiries.js` (all handlers — new `school_id` column added to table), `api/magic-link.js` (new learner INSERT now includes `school_id` from token).

3. **DB migrations:** Added `school_id` column (DEFAULT 1) + index to `enquiries` and `magic_link_tokens` tables.

4. **Error exposure cleanup:** Replaced all ~50 instances of `details: err.message` with `details: 'Internal server error'` across every API file. Server-side `console.error(err)` retained for logging.

5. **Auth migration:** Migrated local `verifyAuth()`/`verifyAdmin()` in `api/address-lookup.js`, `api/update-status.js`, `api/videos.js`, `api/credits.js`, `api/enquiries.js` to use centralised `requireAuth()` from `api/_auth.js`. Removed dead `setCors()` stubs from these files plus `api/slots.js`.

6. **Rate limiting:** Added rate limiting to `api/enquiries.js` submit action (5 per IP per hour), matching the pattern from `magic-link.js`.

7. **SEO/perf quick wins:** Compressed `FraserDiag.JPG` (5.4MB) to `FraserDiag.webp` (200KB). Fixed OG domain from `coachcarter.co.uk` to `coachcarter.uk` in `coachcarter-landing.html` and `lessons.html`. Added `loading="lazy"` to below-fold testimonial images. Darkened `--muted` colour from `#797879` to `#595959` for WCAG 4.5:1 contrast ratio.

8. **Privacy policy update:** Added Anthropic (Claude AI), postcodes.io, and OpenRouteService to "Who we share your data with" section in `public/privacy.html`.

**Files changed:** `api/create-checkout-session.js`, `api/availability.js`, `api/slots.js`, `api/instructor.js`, `api/learner.js`, `api/admin.js`, `api/enquiries.js`, `api/magic-link.js`, `api/address-lookup.js`, `api/update-status.js`, `api/videos.js`, `api/credits.js`, `api/advisor.js`, `api/config.js`, `api/cron-retention.js`, `api/instructors.js`, `api/migrate.js`, `api/offers.js`, `api/reviews.js`, `api/seed-test-data.js`, `api/verify-session.js`, `db/migration.sql`, `public/coachcarter-landing.html`, `public/lessons.html`, `public/privacy.html`, `public/FraserDiag.webp` (new)

- **Setmore sync:** Ongoing import from Setmore booking system via REST API. Cron every 15 min (`api/setmore-sync.js`). Imports as real `lesson_bookings` with `created_by='setmore_sync'`. Pulls pickup addresses from customer profiles. Idempotent via `setmore_key`. Both systems run in parallel during transition.
- **InstructorBook product split (April 2026):** Strategic plan to launch InstructorBook (instructorbook.co.uk) as a national SaaS for driving instructors, separate from CoachCarter's learner-facing brand. Same codebase, two front doors. CoachCarter becomes school #1 in the InstructorBook network. See `INSTRUCTORBOOK-PLAN.md` for full strategy, pricing model, competitive analysis, and marketplace phasing.
